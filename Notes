At this point in time I have been able to pull information from the top command but it has come with two limitations.
It is too slow and does not effectivly calculate idle CPU time.

I have read more about the /proc directory and I am understanding its potential.
I will be utilizing multithreading to accomplicte my goals.

Using a custom stress tester, the idle does not drop to zero unless all cores are loaded,
    So it will stay 100 if a single core is not being utilized at all,
    This will be kept in mind as I make the algorithm.
    The alternative to this is the take the top X processes, and take their %CPU scores.
    Work from there. (X is the number of cores available from the CPU).


I was working with the second idea and came to a realization:
'''
For PS the percent CPU is based on the lifetime of the process. Basically (user time + system time) / (now - process start time).

So 5% means the process has been bothering the CPU 5% of the time it has been alive.

Top does it differently, it's based on the refresh time of top. So most of the time these numbers will not match.

I think I am just hitting the limit that what ever I do, I can not 
get the overall CPU utilization. I don't know how windows does it.
But maybe I should investigate and see if that gives me an answer.


Due to time restrictions, I will just be using the data from 
readingProcStat.c

One thing I need to look into implementing in the future is utilizing nice values.
Follow this webcite: https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/manipulate-process-priority

look into the sys/* header

In the future, look into how windows calculcates CPU utilization

There is a possible output to use is /proc/loadavg
